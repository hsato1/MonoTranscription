# MonoTranscription
## Overview of the Project
* Sight-singing is a practice of, given a sheet music, and a scale or starting pitch, one is required to sing through a given example by reading the music. *This is an extremely important skill for singers and is a difficult skill to develop. 
* As a musician myself, practicing this skill can be very challenging.
* I wanted to develop a software which can provide feedback of where the singer sang wrong intervals or pitch.
* As the beginning of this software, I tackled the problem of **monophonic music audio transcription for recorded vocal audio ðŸŽ¼**

## Implementation
### Key Concepts
  * Use of FFT (Fourier Transform)
  * Hidden Markov Model Structure
  * Dynamic Programming
